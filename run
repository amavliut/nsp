# matrices must be stored in coordinate format, either in binary (by default, ascii = 0) or ascii (ascii = 1).
# by default it assumes that the matrix pattern is stored in long int, while values are stored in double format.
# the header of matrix is of the format [nrows ncols nterms] when header = 1 (by default)
# and [nrows nterms] when header = 0.
# the partition among MPI ranks is done by splitting nrows
